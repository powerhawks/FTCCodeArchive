How code should be structured
There should be a class for:
    Components - Each component of the robot (e.g. Drive, Lift, Grabber) ( name structure: <name of component><team number> )
        Component classes should not contain any loops or telemetry
    OpMode - Every OpMode ( name structure: <name of opmode><teamnumber> )

Inside each class
    ( labelling structure: <date of creation>
                           <names of creators>
                           <very brief description>)
    (e.g.  November 14, 2017
